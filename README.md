Currently, the work we are doing is in the empirical folder. Here, we mainly focus on modeling empirical data and estimating parameters. Firstly, the most important file is the control file, which essentially performs all the tasks. Based on this, filtering, library, and preprocessing are executed. Finally, using these, we run the evaluation and filter_redo for the post-hoc evaluation.
